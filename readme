##  Driver Drowsiness Detection System with OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Machine Learning

This Jupyter Notebook implements a driver drowsiness detection system using computer vision, machine learning, and the following libraries:

* OpenCV: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
* TensorFlow: For building and training the machine learning model.
* playsound: for playing security alaram
* numpy:   for performing  Efficient  analysis on Multidimensional Arrays

**Project Overview:**

The goal of this project is to develop a system that can detect drowsiness in drivers based on facial features and eye closure patterns. The system will likely involve the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:**  
    - Collect image of drivers exhibiting various levels of drowsiness (drowsy and alert).
    - Preprocess the image to extract relevant facial features.

2. **Model Training:**
    - Train a machine learning model (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network - CNN) to classify facial features as belonging to a drowsy or alert state based on the extracted features.


**This Jupyter Notebook focuses on:  **

1. **Data Preprocessing :** Include code for loading, preprocessing, and feature extraction.
2. **Model Building:** Define a CNN architecture suitable for drowsiness detection using TensorFlow or Keras. 
3. **Model Training:** Train the model on a drowsiness detection dataset (consider using a publicly available dataset). 
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set to assess its accuracy in drowsiness detection.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Install Required Libraries:** Ensure you have OpenCV, TensorFlow, and other necessary libraries installed in your Python environment.
2. **Download Dataset (Optional):** Download it and modify the code paths accordingly. 
3. **Run the Notebook:** Open the Jupyter Notebook or google colab and execute the code cells sequentially.

**Note:** This is a basic framework, and you might need to modify or add functionalities depending on your specific dataset and desired system complexity.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Consider data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
* Explore different CNN architectures or hyperparameter tuning for potentially better performance.
* Implement real-time drowsiness detection using techniques like frame differencing and facial landmark detection.

This project provides a starting point for building a driver drowsiness detection system. Feel free to customize and extend it based on your specific needs and research goals.
